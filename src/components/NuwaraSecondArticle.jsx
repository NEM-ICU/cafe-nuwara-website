              King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, reigning during the late 18th and
              early 19th centuries, emerges as a pivotal figure in Kandy's
              history. With unwavering determination, he valiantly safeguarded
              Kandy's autonomy against colonial encroachment. Notably, his
              legacy includes the construction of the revered Sri Dalada
              Maligawa, a testament to his devotion to both Buddhism and his
              people. Despite his efforts, the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 marked
              the beginning of British influence, culminating in the Kandyan
              Convention of 1815 and his subsequent exile. King Sri Vikrama
              Rajasinha's reign embodies a tale of resilience in the face of
              changing tides, forever etched in the narrative of Kandy's storied
              past.
